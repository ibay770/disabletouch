Disable touch for broken Surface Pro, and  other devices.
This is just a registry key which disables touch in the case of a shattered sceeen and disables ghost touches.

Just  run the registry file and restart. 
In the case of  a damaged surface, it may be easier to simply boot to a PE and then copy the reg to 
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

and it will automatically run when the tablet boots up.

A powershell script is also included which does not require  a restart but it does need elevated privileges , unfortunately I haveen't found a way to make it one click, feel free to comment with suggestions.
